Restricted administration rights
================================

The module makes impossible for administrator set (and see) more access rights (groups) than he already have.

This doesn't affect superuser, of course.

Typical usage of the module.
----------------------------

The superuser create an administrator user without access group "Show Apps Menu" (see **access_apps** module). Then the administrator have access to settings, but not able to install new apps (without this module he can add himself to "Show Apps Menu" and get access to apps).
